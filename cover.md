# a generic cover letter


I am an experienced software engineer who is passionate about solving 
interesting problems. I tend toward system-level software interacting with
components whether they are in-process, inter-process, or remote across the 
network.

I absolutely love C++ and the vast expressibility of the language. From new
modern C++ features providing advanced capabilities (e.g., `std::atomic` et al.)
to the low-level system calls that 'have always been there'.

Other language experiments build upon an existing C++ 'foundation' by
providing new features and safety mechanisms -- sometimes fully hiding the 
underlying mechanism. While C++ does this as well 
(e.g., [`std::format`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/format/format)),
in general, the original (if you will) mechanism `printf()` is still there for
the times when the efficiency and simplicity of `printf()` is needed.

I'm very much a pragmatic engineer who seeks to find and use the proper tool(s) 
in solving the problem at hand. For example, maybe bash for scripting, python or
nodejs for web apps, and C++ for system-level applications. Or, maybe python for 
system applications, C++ (with a little help from a libmicrohttpd friend) 
for a web app with little data processing but blindingly fast execution, and 
nodejs for validation testing.

I fully embrace virtualization (licensed VMWare workstation beta way back when), 
containerization (both through docker and lxc) and orchestration (a la 
docker-compose), and utilize those tools in developing solutions, build 
environments, and multiple-level test environments. I've spent more that a couple 
'mind-meld' sessions presenting docker fundamentals and showing how containers 
can be used to ease / expedite building and testing for multiple platforms and 
multiple instances.

At one time I was an OO evangelist. Anymore, I tend to evangelize the tools that
make engineers more productive, more expressive, and happier, while still 
producing quality, testable, and robust solutions for all users / stakeholders.
But OOP and OOD are still relevant in microservice architectures, and when 
designing systems which minimize coupling.

My goals are to produce sound software solutions, pass on knowledge, learn from
everyone around me, and work to make everyone and everything better for all 
involved.
