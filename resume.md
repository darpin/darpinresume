## SKILLS
Extensive experience designing and implementing software systems in a wide 
array of languages and technologies. Most comfortable with C++ and system-level
applications; lots of experience with SaaS and cloud services over the last few 
years.

Experience in modern technologies e.g., OO, containerization, microservices, 
cloud, REST.

Full understanding of the development lifecycle, agile processes / ceremonies, 
and a desire to drive the processes in efficient and useful ways making the 
company grow and helping people become better at what they do both 
professionally and personally.

Math geek who enjoys measuring things, gathering data, identifying trends, 
experimenting with, and “discovering” what the numbers might mean.

Extreme interest in identifying and gathering metrics measuring all aspects of 
software development including inception, planning, and mapping, as well as, 
typical development tasks, and using such to identify trends and gauge 
performance.

Eager to lead and inspire others (not just engineers) to become better at their
craft, whether as their peer, leader, or underling.

Love of all things tech. With an eye for new tools and techniques to do really 
cool things.

## OBJECTIVE

Secure a position leading and driving development of interesting, useful 
software and services, where I can build teams and develop engineers, plan and 
build architectures and software solutions, and mentor and help others in the 
same and on their path. Specifically, interested in ‘leadership’ roles driving
planning, requirements, and processes where tools and techniques are identified 
and research performed for proper usage in potential solutions, and driving 
execution to successful deployment.
