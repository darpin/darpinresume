## SKILLS
Extensive experience designing and implementing software systems in a wide 
array of languages and technologies. Most comfortable with C++ and
system-level applications; lots of experience with SaaS and cloud
services over the last few years.

Experience in modern technologies e.g., OO, containerization,
microservices, cloud, REST.

Full understanding of the development lifecycle, agile
processes / ceremonies, and a desire to drive the processes in
efficient and useful ways making the team and company grow and helping
people become better at what they do both professionally and
personally.

Math geek who enjoys measuring things, gathering data,
identifying trends, experimenting with, and “discovering” what the numbers
might mean.

Extreme interest in identifying and gathering metrics measuring all
aspects of software development including inception, planning, and mapping, as 
well as, typical development tasks, and using such to identify trends and gauge 
performance.

Eager to lead and inspire others (not just engineers) to become
better at their craft, whether as their peer, leader, or underling.

Love of all things tech. With an eye for new tools and techniques to do really 
cool things.

## OBJECTIVE

Secure a position leading and driving development of interesting,
useful software and services, where I can write software, build
teams, and develop engineers, plan and build architectures and
software solutions, and mentor and help others in the same and on
their path.

Specifically, interested in ‘leadership’ roles driving planning,
requirements, and processes where tools and techniques are
identified and research performed for proper usage in potential solutions,
and driving execution to successful deployment.
